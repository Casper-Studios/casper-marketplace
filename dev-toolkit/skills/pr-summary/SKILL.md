Summarize the latest changes in this branch to create a pull request on GitHub.

<workflow-steps>

1. Compare the current branch against `dev` to see what changes need to be described in the pull request. Make sure to only focus on the finalized implementation details. Since pull requests tend to have work-in-progress commits at the beginning, you should be extra mindful on whether these are still relevant in the finalized snapshot.
2. Use the [pull request template](assets/pull-request-template.md) to generate a `.claude/scratchpad/PR.md`.
3. Pause here and prompt the user to check the `.claude/scratchpad/PR.md` before proceeding.
4. Once edited and approved by the user, fill in the missing details in the following script and then run it:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base dev --head "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" --title '[TICKET-123] category: short title' --body-file .claude/scratchpad/PR.md
   ```
5. Delete `.claude/scratchpad/PR.md` once successfully submitted.
